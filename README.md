# Bridging Gaps Between Languages

Written by: **Ethan Bailey**

## Project Description:
A transcompiler is a source-to-source translator. It converts the code from one programming language to another.
It often has been said that many languages stem from and are based on the language known as C. Is there any way we can prove this?
Though this method may be a rather roundabout way to prove a theory, creating a transcompiler that can turn many other
high-level programming languages (such as Python, Java, C++, R,  Fortan, etc.).

### Some of the current models that relate to the project include:
- CodeCovert AI and CodePal Language Translator - that both convert multiple languages to one another through the use of artificial intelligence.
- JLCA (Java Language Conversion Assistant) - is a tool that automatically translates current Java code into Visual C# code.
- BCX – is a tiny command-line tool that takes a BCX BASIC source code file and converts it into a ‘C’ source code file that can be compiled with any C or C++ compiler.
- PERTHON – translates Python source code to Perl 5.x source code that humans can read. It parses using Damian Conway’s Parse::Rec Descent and seeks to re-implement the Python language according to the Python Reference Manual and BNF grammar.
- Google’s GWT – that can create and debug AJAX apps in Java using your preferred Java development tools. The GWT compiler converts your Java application to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML when you push it to production. 
- Facebook’s hiphop – compiles your PHP source code using g++ after programmatically converting it to highly efficient C++.
- Facebook’s TransCoder AI – TransCoder, a Facebook system that can translate between C++, Java, and Python.
